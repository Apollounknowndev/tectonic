**Tectonic** is a world generation datapack and mod that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.

## Features

### Mountain Ranges

The way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, reaching peaks above y300!

### Underground Rivers

In mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.

### Smoother Surfaces

One of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as "lerp" issues - is gone.

### Deeper Oceans

Oceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!

## Compatibility

The datapack version of Tectonic will not work with datapacks like Terralith or William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld, but datapacks that do not add biomes and mods in general *will* work with Tectonic.

The mod version of Tectonic should be compatible with basically anything.

## Removed Features

Previous versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons.
